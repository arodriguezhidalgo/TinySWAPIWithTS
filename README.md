# Having fun with Typescript and SWAPI.

## Topics covered
This is a small project to have some fun while covering the following topics:

* Coding and transpiling some Typescript code.
* Implementing some tests using Jest and potentially Selenium.
* This is a single-page app.

## Future topics to cover
Things that I haven't covered yet but it would be cool to do
* Packaging using Vite.
* Implement some proper CSS for this.
* Start using React.js.

## Setup
1. Clone repo.
2. Run ">> npm -install".
